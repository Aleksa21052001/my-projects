# My Projects

This folder contains some of my projects: 


- **Heart Disease Classification** – A machine learning project focused on predicting heart attacks based on various medical parameters.

- **Pneumonia Classification** – A deep learning project using convolutional neural networks to classify chest X-ray images as normal or pneumonia.

- **Spectral Filtering for Noise Suppression** – An image processing project where structured noise is suppressed by preprocessing images in the spectral domain.
